# SystemOrientationAlgorithm
IMU Fusion algorithm inorder to retrieve system orientation, ST's AlgoBuilder IDE

**Ongoing Project**

## How to compile and run

Algorithm is run on NUCLEO-F401RE (https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html) ST microprocessor, with
X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 ST motion MEMS attached (https://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks01a2.html).

the micro-processor should be connected by microUSB to your PC.

###IDE Installation
Next you must install and download AlgoBuilder: https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/algobuilder.html
Unicleo GUI: https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/unicleo-gui.html
System workbench for STM32: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/sw4stm32.html
STSW UtilityLink: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html

After installing and downloading all of the above follow the next steps:
1. Open AlgoBuilder
2. Open MARG Desgin
3. Compile and run
4. Open Unicleo 
5. Click Start

you can now observe a 3D model of the system, simulation movement should mimic sensor movement.
